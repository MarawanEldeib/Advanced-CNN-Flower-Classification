## üéØ Project Overview

### Goal
Implement, train, and evaluate machine learning models on customer data to achieve accurate predictions and determine the best-performing model.

---

## ‚öôÔ∏è Steps and Implementation

### 1. Download and Load Dataset
- **Libraries Used:**
  - `pandas` for data manipulation and analysis
  - `numpy` for numerical operations
  - `scikit-learn` for machine learning models and preprocessing
  - `matplotlib.pyplot` and `seaborn` for data visualization

### 2. Visualize Data Distribution
- **Graphs:**
    
  <img src="age_distribution.png" alt="Age Distribution" width="400"/>  

  <img src="income_vs_spending.png" alt="Income vs. Spending Score" width="400"/>

### 3. Data Preparation and Scaling
- Selected necessary columns (age, annual income, spending score)
- Scaled data using `StandardScaler`

### 4. Determine Optimal Number of Clusters
- Used Silhouette Score to find optimal clusters (2-10)
- **Graph:**

### 5. k-Means Clustering
- Applied k-Means with 6 clusters to scaled data

### 6. Logistic Regression and Performance Metrics
- 5-fold cross-validation with Logistic Regression

## üìä Results

### Visuals and Performance
- **Optimal number of clusters:** 6
- **Accuracy scores from 5-fold cross-validation:** [0.925, 1.0, 1.0, 1.0, 0.9]
- **Mean accuracy:** 0.965
